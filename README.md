# Lane-Detection-OpenCV
Hi ,
In this project I tried to write a script that detects lane lines using Python and OpenCV. 
The main idea was to focus on a determined region of focus , so Instead of working with the entire frame, we can work with only a part of the it in which we detect the road edges and draw them on a real time video stream .
